# Cnn-dog-cat-classifier
Building a CNN model that classifies images as either a cat or a dog.

We would need to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set would be used to train the model, while the testing set would be used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Then, we would need to build a CNN model using a deep learning. The model architecture would typically consist of several convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and a few fully connected layers at the end.

After building the model, we would need to compile it and specify the loss function, optimizer, and metrics to use during training. The loss function would typically be categorical cross-entropy, the optimizer could be Adam, and the metrics could be accuracy.

Finally, we would train the model on the training set, monitor its performance on the testing set, and adjust the hyperparameters as necessary to achieve the best results. Once the model is trained and optimized, we can use it to classify new images as either a cat or a dog.
